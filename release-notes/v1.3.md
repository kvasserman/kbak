- Added the ability to stream (pipe) reference backup in diff and restore modes. 

    For example, the following command creates a differential backup by streaming the source, the reference and output to/from remote ssh host:
    > `$ ssh user@host "cat myfile" | kbak --diff -r <(ssh user@host "cat myfile.full.kbak") | ssh user@host "cat >myfile.diff.kbak"`

- Take a look at [README](https://github.com/kvasserman/kbak) for more details
